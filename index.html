	<h1>This is not an empty page</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph that you can perform mouse events against.</p>
	<p>Use your developer console to test ClickWrapper functionality.</p>
	<p>When hosted in a browser, and not using requirejs, ClickWrapper is exposed as a global.</p>
	<p>Hopefully this will be of use to someone.</p>
	<p>Included Kefir for FRP testing. I think using the fromSubUnsub probably works best.</p>
